# One-shot of the root Compose `keycloak` profile (service keycloak-realms). Copies the realm
# files of heka-sso-service/keycloak into the volume Keycloak imports from, and rewrites the
# issuer of the `heka` realm's heka-sso identity provider to SSO_ISSUER_URL, so the broker
# accepts the bridge's tokens whether its issuer is localhost or an https tunnel
# (docs/root-docker-compose-plan.md, section 9.2). Only the issuer changes: the token, JWKS and
# userinfo URLs keep host.docker.internal, the authorize and logout URLs keep localhost.
#
# Keycloak in start-dev has no persistent volume in this stack, so a recreate re-imports the
# files written here; an existing realm is never updated by --import-realm.
